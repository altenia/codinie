<h2>Programming is should be fun!</h2>
<p>
Programming is (usually) fun. Programming becomes tedious when coding 
no-brainer boiler plate parts such as model or DAO clases where you have
to repeat attributes of the schema entities over and over. Most of it can 
usually be (and should be) automated.
Here is where Codini comes to play. Codini is a PHP based code generator. It 
generates codes based on database metadata, or other schema definition such
as Hibernate's HBM file.

<ul>
	<li>Uses customizable templating (PHP based) to generate code.</li>
	<li>Multiple projects.</li>
	<li>Supports multiple data sources: MySQL, Hibernate, MS SQL. </li>
	<li>Pre-built templates for Java and Scala Model and <abbr title="Data Access Object">DAO</abbr> .</li>
</ul>
